# N-Body Problem

# Introduction

The basic ideas of N-Body problem were published in 1687 by Sir Isaac Newton in his Principia. The limitations to his work was given later by Henry Poincar√©, who described the non-integrability principle as applicable to problems of three and more bodies.
<br> We can determine only 10 classical first integrals, 6 are due to the motion of the cente of mass, 3 from the angular momentum and 1 from energy.
